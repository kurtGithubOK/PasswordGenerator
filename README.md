## The deployed app is here:  https://kurtgithubok.github.io/PasswordGenerator/

## It uses HTML and Javascript.

## The implementation consists of a 'passwordGenerator' object with a generatePassword() function.  That function calls other functions to prompt the user for input, then populate the password with at least one character from each of the criteria, the completes the password by chosing random characters from random criteria the user selected.


## The only problem faced was how to handle the user cancelling out of the prompts.
